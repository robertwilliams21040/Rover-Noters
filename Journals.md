# Journals for calaloging the build of the Rover

### Entry #1 9/6/2020

Looked around the documentation and tried myself with the way this is all going to go down. Created the basics for note taking and created this journal to log progress. I am told that this works, so I am going to try and keep this going for as long as I stick with it. Ordered the custom PCBs and some parts. I need to practice sodering before I start putting the acual boards togeter so I know what I am doing. So far so good...

### Entry #2 9/8/2020

Technially entered on 9/10/2020 (gotta get better about that ). Had a few busy days of work and home life so I pushed the Journal entry back abit. Created the Index for each section and updated the repository. Need to clean my room and look for that sodering practice kit that I know I still have only alittle progress but some progress is better then no progress.

### Entry #3 9/16/2020

Ordered the soldering iron, pratice kits, and desoldering wick. Gonna be a while before I make any more significant progress on the project. Part because I need to learn how to solder, and part because I just dropped like $900 on car repairs. Oh well, thems the BREAKS (inside joke lol).

### Entry #4 9/27/2020

Finished the "Hue" soldering kit. Definiently some take-aways from this practice. First and formost is that un-leaded solder is much harder to work with. Had to take my new soldering iron to over 800+ degrees F to get the melting effect that I was looking for. As long as I am living at home, I will have to keep with it though. Mihael touches my stuff to much for me to consider leaded. Also, it does not take much to make a connection. Applying to much will quickly make excess. Apply solder from the front, not the side, and tinning the soldering iron before applying is important for the heat transfer. All and all, successful large step forward.
