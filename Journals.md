# Journals for calaloging the build of the Rover

### Entry #1 9/6/2020

Looked around the documentation and tried myself with the way this is all going to go down. Created the basics for note taking and created this journal to log progress. I am told that this works, so I am going to try and keep this going for as long as I stick with it. Ordered the custom PCBs and some parts. I need to practice sodering before I start putting the acual boards togeter so I know what I am doing. So far so good...

### Entry #2 9/8/2020

Technially entered on 9/10/2020 (gotta get better about that ). Had a few busy days of work and home life so I pushed the Journal entry back abit. Created the Index for each section and updated the repository. Need to clean my room and look for that sodering practice kit that I know I still have only alittle progress but some progress is better then no progress.
