# Journals for calaloging the build of the Rover


***
### Entry #1 9/6/2020

Looked around the documentation and tried myself with the way this is all going to go down. Created the basics for note taking and created this journal to log progress. I am told that this works, so I am going to try and keep this going for as long as I stick with it. Ordered the custom PCBs and some parts. I need to practice sodering before I start putting the acual boards togeter so I know what I am doing. So far so good...
